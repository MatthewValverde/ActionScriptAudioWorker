ActionScriptAudioWorker
=======================

ActionScript Audio Worker example.

This example shows one way to create a Sound on your primordial thread, while processing the SampleDataEvent from within the Worker.

If anyone has a more optimized way of doing this, please share.

I hope this helps.

Enjoy!
